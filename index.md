## Welcome to DALi

This guide will take you through what you need to know to produce efficient, dynamic and visually rich applications in DALi easily.<br>

## What is DALi

DALi is a dynamic animation library, a 2D and 3D scene graph that abstracts the rendering of the nodes through a simple API.<br>

It can be used to create 2D and 3D applications, providing support for resource loading, touch events, key events, animating the nodes and a whole array of functionality to make it easy for the user to produce effects, applications and user interfaces.<br>

DALi is developed with user input responsiveness, smooth updates with good FPS and low memory requirements in mind.<br>

A Toolkit is provided to make using DALi even easier along with a framework that facilitates the creating of your own controls.<br>

DALi is Open Source, constantly maintained and extended.<br>

DALi provides 2 apis, the native C++ and NUI which is based on C#.

## Getting Started

DALi repositories are avaiable in GitHub with instructions to install and build.<br>
